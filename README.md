Predictive Maintenance: A Practical Perspective
=========================
A repo for my article/report on predictive maintenance (PdM) and its 
practical challenges in industrial settings. 

The article is meant as a place to keep my learnings. I expect to 
continuously update the document or the repo with new information. 
The repo here allows easy sharing with others, as well as synchronization 
between my working stations.
